Recreated google homepage.

Decent.

Issues that need working on 

- sticking the footer to the bottom of the page.
- aligning the K logo with the rest of the nav links
- searchbar / input in general
- mobile responsiveness (didn't put any in the site but should make it a habit)
- the right way to resize logos/images
