Recreated google homepage.

Decent.

Issues that need working on 

- the right way to resize logos/images
- hover over button moves the bottom half of the page 

Issues fixed

/ Mobile responsiveness
/ searchbar / input in general
/ aligning the K logo with the rest of the nav links
/ sticking the footer to the bottom of the page [This was solved by swaping the main margin-bottom out for a min-height for the main, which I calculated by subtracting the height of the header and the footer from 100vh].
