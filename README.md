Recreated google homepage.

Decent.

Issues fixed

- Mobile responsiveness
- searchbar / input in general
- aligning the K logo with the rest of the nav links
- sticking the footer to the bottom of the page [This was solved by swaping the main margin-bottom out for a min-height for the main, which I calculated by subtracting the height of the header and the footer from 100vh].
- Button border was made the same as when it hovered to avoid movement. Buttons could be sized with a width and height also. Small hack.
